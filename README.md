**Can we save those 20k Rs people with just a simple blood test?**

In India, genetic testing for MEN2 costs INR 20,000 (~$225 USD), putting life-saving diagnosis out of reach for most families. This research asks: *can machine learning on routine blood biomarkers (calcitonin, CEA) and clinical features predict MTC risk without expensive genetic sequencing?*

MEN2 Predictor evaluates whether published MEN2/RET-carrier records can support a transparent rare-disease machine-learning benchmark for MTC status. The scientific answer must stay modest: this is not a diagnostic, screening, triage, or clinical decision-support system.

MEN2 Predictor now aggregates **149 confirmed RET carriers from 10 peer-reviewed studies (14 variants)** into a reproducible pipeline. On the real literature-derived cohort, **XGBoost reached 100% sensitivity** with **83.33% accuracy**. The expanded case-control workflow reaches **96.19% accuracy with LightGBM**, but those augmented records are not a real clinical cohort.

## Key Findings

### Real-Patient Cohort (149 carriers across 10 studies)

The paper-only dataset now contains **149 confirmed carriers** across **14 RET variants**. On this filtered cohort, **XGBoost** is the primary exploratory model because it reached **100% sensitivity** with **83.33% accuracy**. The expanded synthetic-augmentation analysis is secondary; **LightGBM on expanded data achieves 96.19% accuracy** with **90.20% recall**.

### Synthetic Augmentation Impact

Synthetic controls + SMOTE expand the case-control dataset to **1,047 records**. After filtering out the post-diagnostic and mixed-heavy papers, the biomarker coupling analysis is based on **12 paired calcitonin/CEA observations from 6 studies**. Expanded models improve discrimination in simulation, while the original-data XGBoost model remains the primary literature-derived benchmark.

### Clinical Interpretation

- **Primary exploratory result:** XGBoost on the paper-only cohort reached **100% sensitivity** with **83.33% accuracy**.
- **Highest simulated accuracy:** LightGBM on expanded data achieves **96.19% accuracy** with **90.20% recall**.
- **Model interpretation:** XGBoost-original is the primary literature-derived benchmark; LightGBM-expanded is a secondary synthetic-augmentation result.

### Statistical Tests on Recall Drops

- Permutation tests show **no significant recall loss** for Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, or SVM. LightGBM shows a significant **recall gain** on the expanded dataset (`p = 0.0422`), improving from 66.7% to 90.2%.
- McNemar's test remains mostly uninformative because overlapping positive patients are sparse across original and expanded test sets.
- Full bootstrap and permutation summaries live at `results/statistical_tests/statistical_significance_tests.txt` (generated automatically when running both datasets together via `python main.py --m=all --d=both`; statistical tests run only in the both-datasets workflow).

### Why This Matters

#### 1. Saving the 20k Rs People

In India, genetic testing for MEN2 costs INR 20,000 (~$225 USD), putting life-saving diagnosis out of reach for many families. The central question is whether machine learning on routine blood biomarkers like calcitonin and CEA, plus clinical features, can identify useful MTC-risk patterns without immediately depending on expensive genetic sequencing.

#### 2. Why This Matters for Rare-Disease ML

Every documented carrier in these studies represents scarce published evidence, and every delayed answer can matter to a family trying to understand inherited cancer risk. The benchmark makes model assumptions visible, especially whether non-genetic blood biomarkers and clinical features retain signal when RET/ATA features are removed, along with CEA imputation uncertainty, biomarker-timing leakage risk, and the limits of synthetic augmentation.

Even with the filtered cohort at **149 patients and 12 paired calcitonin/CEA observations**, synthetic augmentation remains model-dependent. Accuracy climbs into the 96% band, but the primary evidence remains the original-data benchmark rather than the expanded workflow.

### Learning Paradigm Coverage

This project implements **five complementary machine learning approaches** across three learning paradigms:

**Linear Models:**
- **Logistic Regression**: Baseline interpretability with coefficient-based feature importance

**Tree-Based Ensembles:**
- **Random Forest**: Bagging with uncertainty quantification via tree voting
- **XGBoost**: Gradient boosting with L1/L2 regularization
- **LightGBM**: Efficient gradient boosting with leaf-wise growth

**Kernel-Based Learning:**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Maximum-margin classification with linear kernel optimized for small datasets

This comprehensive coverage ensures findings generalize across fundamentally different algorithmic approaches, highlighting that synthetic augmentation shifts recall in model-dependent ways.

### Calcitonin vs CEA Biomarker Coupling (Multi-study)

- Integrated **6 cohorts with paired calcitonin/CEA labs** yielding **12 observed pairs** in the filtered dataset.
- Pearson correlation is now **r = 0.116**, reflecting a much weaker but still measurable coupling after removing post-diagnostic-heavy studies.
- `create_datasets.py` tags every patient with `cea_level_numeric`, `cea_elevated`, and `cea_imputed_flag`. Those 12 observed pairs seed the **MICE + Predictive Mean Matching** pipeline that fills the remaining **137 gaps**.
- Full provenance is saved in `results/biomarker_summary/biomarker_ceaimputation_summary.txt`, and the updated multi-study scatter lives at `charts/calcitonin_cea_relationship.png`.

### CEA Imputation Validation Study

**Concern addressed:** Weak calcitonin-CEA correlation (**r = 0.1158** from **12 paired observations**) may undermine imputation reliability.

**Key findings from `src/cea_validation_study.py`:**

| Analysis | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Best recall model | **XGBoost-original** keeps **100% recall** with or without CEA, and reaches **90.00% accuracy without CEA** |
| Best accuracy model | **LightGBM-expanded** improves from **92.86% without CEA** to **96.19% with CEA** |
| Conclusion | CEA is **model-dependent**: optional for XGBoost-original, helpful for LightGBM-expanded |

**Imputation Method Comparison (LightGBM, Expanded Dataset):**

| Method | Accuracy | Recall | Δ vs MICE |
|--------|----------|--------|-----------|
| MICE+PMM | **96.19%** | 90.20% | --- |
| Mean imputation | 93.81% | 86.27% | -2.38% |
| Median imputation | 92.86% | 90.20% | -3.33% |
| Zero imputation | 93.81% | 86.27% | -2.38% |

**Why include CEA?** Because the highest-accuracy simulation model benefits from it. Removing CEA lowers LightGBM-expanded accuracy from **96.19%** to **92.86%**, while XGBoost-original keeps **100% recall** either way. See [detailed rationale](reports/cea_imputation_validation.md).

Run the study: `python src/cea_validation_study.py --m=lightgbm --d=expanded`

## About The Project

**Benchmark question:** This research began with a practical, emotionally direct question: **Can we save those 20k Rs people with just a simple blood test?** In India, genetic testing for MEN2 costs INR 20,000 (~$225 USD), putting life-saving diagnosis out of reach for most families. This research asks: *can machine learning on routine blood biomarkers (calcitonin, CEA) and clinical features predict MTC risk without expensive genetic sequencing?* The study answers that question as a reproducible benchmark, while explicitly testing genotype-aware and genotype-blind models, CEA imputation uncertainty, and synthetic-augmentation limits.

MEN2 (Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 2) is a rare hereditary cancer syndrome caused by RET gene mutations. This project developed machine learning models to predict MTC (medullary thyroid carcinoma) risk across **14 RET variants** using clinical and genetic features from **149 confirmed carriers** across 10 peer-reviewed research studies.

**Scientific Contribution:** This work provides a reproducible rare-disease ML benchmark showing that synthetic augmentation changes performance in a strongly model-dependent way. Augmentation improves simulated accuracy substantially, while the primary literature-derived result comes from **XGBoost on original data**.

## Scientific Contribution

This project makes three main contributions to rare-disease machine learning:

### 1. Model-Dependent Evaluation of Synthetic Augmentation

- Shows that synthetic controls plus SMOTE can improve discrimination while affecting recall differently across algorithms.
- **LightGBM improves from 80.00% to 96.19% accuracy** and from **66.7% to 90.2% recall** when moving from original to expanded data.
- At the same time, the primary original-data benchmark remains with **XGBoost on original data**, which reached **100% sensitivity** in one internal held-out split.

### 2. Methodological Framework for Rare Disease ML

- Systematic comparison: 5 models × 2 datasets = 10 configurations
- Emphasis on raw counts, sensitivity, and confidence intervals for small rare-disease benchmarks
- Validation on real held-out data, not synthetic test sets

### 3. Clinical Deployment Framing

- Reports **XGBoost on original data** as the primary literature-derived benchmark.
- Reports **LightGBM on expanded data** as the highest-accuracy synthetic-augmentation benchmark.
- Provides a reproducible template for comparing genotype-aware, genotype-blind, no-CEA, and augmented analyses in small rare-disease cohorts.

### Publication Status

**Ready for submission** to:

- Journal of High School Science (JHSS) - Current target
- Framed as an exploratory computational methods / original research paper
- Prospective external validation is still required before clinical use

**Estimated impact**: Moderate to high. The project combines reproducible rare-disease data curation, model benchmarking, explainability, and ablation analysis in a clinically interpretable workflow.

### Future Work

### Dataset Organization

The raw clinical data is stored in the [`data/raw`](data/raw) folder as structured json files:

- **[study_1.json](data/raw/study_1.json) ... [study_10.json](data/raw/study_10.json)**: Individual study extracts covering the 10 retained cohorts (see Data Sources table)
- **[literature_data.json](data/raw/literature_data.json)**: Aggregated statistics and meta-data
- **[mutation_characteristics.json](data/raw/mutation_characteristics.json)**: RET variant characteristics

This modular structure allows for:

- Easy data maintenance and updates
- Clear separation of concerns between raw data and processing logic
- Version control of individual study datasets
- Simple addition of new studies as they become available

### Data Processing Pipeline

The [create_datasets.py](src/create_datasets.py) script:

1. Loads patient data from JSON files in the [`data/raw`](data/raw) folder (10 studies)
2. Extracts and combines data from multiple research studies (149 patients, 14 variants across 10 sources)
3. Maps each variant to ATA risk level (1=Moderate, 2=High, 3=Highest)
4. Converts qualitative measurements to structured numeric features
5. Handles multiple reference ranges for calcitonin levels across studies
6. Engineers derived features (age groups, nodule presence, variant-specific interactions)
7. Generates two datasets:
   - `data/processed/ret_multivariant_training_data.csv`: Original 149 patients from literature
   - `data/processed/ret_multivariant_expanded_training_data.csv`: Expanded with synthetic controls
   - `data/processed/ret_multivariant_case_control_dataset.csv`: Further expanded with variant-matched controls

### Important Notes on Data Quality

- **Multi-Variant Dataset:** Includes 14 RET variants with varying penetrance and risk profiles
- **Risk Stratification:** Variants classified by ATA guidelines (Level 1/2/3)
- **Incomplete Penetrance:** Not all carriers develop MTC; penetrance varies by variant
- **Variable Follow-up:** Some carriers elected surveillance over prophylactic surgery
- **Age-Dependent Risk:** Penetrance increases with age, reflected in age-stratified features
- **Variant-Specific Patterns:** High-risk variants (C634\*) show different clinical patterns than moderate-risk (K666N, L790F)
- **Study Heterogeneity:** Different studies used different calcitonin reference ranges and screening protocols

**Key features:**

- **End-to-end pipeline** managed by `main.py`, coordinating all major steps automatically.
- **Multiple ML algorithms:** Support for Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and SVM models.
- **Comprehensive model comparison:** Automatically generates detailed comparison of all 5 models on the same test set with complete patient data, showing which patients each model got right/wrong.
- **Model comparison mode:** Run all models simultaneously and compare performance metrics in a formatted table.
- **Dataset comparison mode:** Compare model performance on expanded dataset (with SMOTE and control cases) vs original paper data.
- **Automated data creation and expansion:** Scripts extract and structure relevant research data, and generate synthetic control samples to augment the dataset for robust modeling.
- **Comprehensive statistical analysis:** Automatic generation of descriptive statistics and visualization of the dataset for informed modeling.
- **Advanced model development:** Cross-validation and adaptive SMOTE balancing to handle class imbalance across all model types.
- **Research risk stratification:** 4-tier exploratory output (Low/Moderate/High/Very High) for transparent model interpretation.
- **Artifacts generated:** Processed datasets, trained model files, ROC curves, confusion matrices, and confidence interval summaries for transparent benchmark scoring.

**Pipeline steps (as run by `main.py`):**

1. **create_datasets.py:** loads all study JSON files (now including Study 5 biomarker panels), computes the calcitonin vs CEA correlation, runs MICE + predictive mean matching to populate `cea_*` features, and emits the processed CSVs.
2. **data_analysis.py:** Computes descriptive statistics, generates variant-specific visualizations and risk-stratified analyses.
3. **data_expansion.py:** Produces variant-matched synthetic control samples to improve model balance.
4. **train_model.py:** Trains models with variant features, cross-validation, SMOTE balancing, and threshold optimization.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Run the complete pipeline:

```sh
python main.py
```

This executes all stages: data preparation, analysis, expansion, training, and testing.

### Model Selection (`--m`)

Choose which model to train:

- `l` or `logistic`: Logistic Regression (baseline)
- `r` or `random_forest`: Random Forest (research comparison)
- `x` or `xgboost`: XGBoost
- `g` or `lightgbm`: LightGBM (research comparison)
- `s` or `svm`: Support Vector Machine (linear kernel)
- `a` or `all`: Run all models and compare

### Dataset Selection (`--d`)

Choose which dataset to use:

- `o` or `original`: Original 149 patients (no synthetic data) ⭐ **Recommended for clinical use**
- `e` or `expanded`: Expanded with synthetic controls + SMOTE (default)
- `b` or `both`: Run on both datasets for comparison


### Examples

```sh
# Primary original-cohort benchmark run: XGBoost on original data
python main.py --m=xgboost --d=original

# Research comparison: LightGBM on original data
python main.py --m=lightgbm --d=original

# Test SVM (kernel-based learning) on original data
python main.py --m=svm --d=original

# Compare all models on original dataset (identify best performer)
python main.py --m=all --d=original

# Compare the full benchmark across both datasets
python main.py --m=all --d=both

# Triage-oriented high-accuracy run
python main.py --m=lightgbm --d=expanded
```


### Model Comparison Mode

When using `--m=all`, the pipeline:

1. Runs data preparation once (shared across models)
2. Trains and tests all five model types sequentially
3. Saves detailed logs to `results/logs/`
4. Displays comprehensive comparison table

### Dataset Comparison Mode

When using `--d=both`, the pipeline:

1. Runs the model on the expanded dataset (synthetic + SMOTE)
2. Runs the same model on the original dataset
3. Generates separate results files
4. Displays a comparison table showing performance differences

This mode compares how each model behaves on the paper-only cohort versus the expanded case-control workflow.

Statistical significance tests are triggered automatically only when running both datasets together (e.g., `python main.py --m=all --d=both`).

### Ablation Study (`--ablation`)

The ablation study systematically removes feature groups to test the model's reliance on genetic vs biomarker features. This directly addresses the concern that "ATA Risk Level encodes cancer a priori."

**Run via main pipeline:**

```sh
# Ablation study with LightGBM on expanded dataset
python main.py --ablation --m=lightgbm --d=expanded
```

**Or run the standalone script directly:**

```sh
# Full ablation study (all models, both datasets) - 80 experiments
python src/ablation_study.py --m=all --d=both

# Specific model/dataset combinations
python src/ablation_study.py --m=lightgbm --d=expanded
python src/ablation_study.py --m=xgboost --d=original
python src/ablation_study.py --m=random_forest --d=both
```

**Ablation Configurations:**

| Configuration | Features Removed | Purpose |
|---------------|------------------|---------|
| `baseline` | None | Full model performance |
| `no_risk_level` | `ret_risk_level`, interactions | Test ATA risk contribution |
| `no_variants` | All `variant_*` dummies | Test variant encoding contribution |
| `no_genetics` | All genetic features | Pure biomarker prediction |
| `no_calcitonin` | `calcitonin_*` features | Test if genetics alone suffice |
| `no_cea` | `cea_level_numeric` | Address CEA imputation concerns |
| `genetics_only` | All biomarkers, nodules | Test if model is "just consensus" |
| `biomarkers_only` | All genetic features | Clinical utility without genetics |

**Results saved to:** `results/ablation/`
- `{model}_{dataset}_ablation_results.txt` - Detailed findings
- `{model}_{dataset}_ablation_results.csv` - For analysis

**Key Finding:** In the highest-accuracy model, LightGBM-expanded still reaches **93.33% accuracy** after removing all genetic features. In the primary original-data benchmark, XGBoost-original preserves **100% recall** even after removing CEA and variant one-hot encodings.

**Calcitonin Feature Behavior:** In the highest-accuracy model, removing calcitonin lowers LightGBM-expanded accuracy from **96.19% to 95.24%**. In the primary original-data benchmark, XGBoost-original retains **100% recall** even without calcitonin. Full analysis in [ablation_feature_contribution_analysis.md](reports/ablation_feature_contribution_analysis.md).

### Explainability (SHAP + LIME)

- Explainability runs automatically during testing (including `python main.py --m=all --d=both`). Use `python src/test_model.py --no-explain ...` to skip.
- **SHAP**:
  - Text: `results/shap/<model>/<model>_<dataset>.txt` (e.g., `results/shap/logistic/logistic_expanded.txt`)
  - Charts (PNG): `charts/shap/<model>/` (`expanded_bar.png`, `original_bar.png`)
- **LIME** (local explanations + global summary over selected cases):
  - Results: `results/lime/<model>/`
  - Charts (PNG): `charts/lime/<model>/` (per-sample LIME plots + `lime_global_importance.png` + `lime_shap_global_<dataset>.png`)
  - The script explains 5 correctly classified + up to 5 misclassified cases (false negatives prioritized).
  - Counterfactual suggestions (when possible) are written to `results/lime/<model>/<model>_<dataset>_counterfactuals.txt`.
- Summary: `results/explainability_summary.txt`

### Hugging Face Space (Gradio UI + API)

Interactive demo and hosted inference are available via the Hugging Face Space:

`https://huggingface.co/spaces/arjuncodess/men2-predictor`

- **Gradio app:** Use the web UI to enter patient features and view the predicted MEN2/MTC risk output.
- **API:** You can call the Space programmatically. The easiest way is `gradio_client`:

```python
from gradio_client import Client

client = Client("arjuncodess/men2-predictor")
client.view_api()
# Then call the printed endpoint with client.predict(...)
```

**Disclaimer for the Space:** The hosted app/API is provided as-is for demonstration only. It may change without notice, and it must not be used for real-world clinical decisions.

### Model comparison with patient data

**New feature:** Every test run now automatically generates a comprehensive comparison of all 5 models on the same test set, showing complete patient data alongside each model's predictions.

**What you get:**

The comparison table includes for each test patient:
- **Patient identification**: study_id for original data, source_id for synthetic controls
- **Complete clinical data**: age, sex, RET variant, risk level, calcitonin levels, nodules, family history, etc.
- **Actual diagnosis**: MTC or No_MTC
- **All model predictions**: LR, RF, LGB, XGB, SVM (marked OK for correct, XX for incorrect)
- **Color-coded terminal output**: green for correct predictions, red for incorrect
- **Accuracy summary**: total correct/incorrect for each model

**Saved file:** `results/model_comparison/model_comparison_{dataset_type}_detailed_results.txt`

This file includes:
- Complete legend explaining all abbreviations
- Data split methodology (80/20, stratified, random_state=42)
- SMOTE application details (only on training data)
- All held-out test patients with full clinical data
- Model predictions for easy comparison

**Why this matters:**

1. **Transparency**: See exactly which patients each model got right or wrong
2. **Pattern identification**: Identify difficult cases that multiple models miss
3. **Clinical validation**: Verify models make sense given patient characteristics
4. **Research utility**: Comprehensive data for publication and analysis
5. **Debugging**: Quickly spot if synthetic controls are causing issues

**Data split explained:**

- **Method**: 80/20 train/test split with random_state=42 (reproducible)
- **Stratification**: Maintains MTC vs No MTC ratio in both sets
- **SMOTE**: Applied only to training data after split
- **Test set**: 100% real data (original patients + synthetic controls, no SMOTE)

**Note on "synthetic controls":**

Patients with source_id (e.g., "33_control", "mtc_s0_control") are synthetic controls added to expand the dataset. These are not from SMOTE—they were generated before the train/test split and are treated as real data. SMOTE is only applied to the training set after splitting.

- Age-dependent risk: penetrance increases with age
- Variant-specific patterns: high-risk variants (C634\*) show different clinical patterns
- Study heterogeneity: different calcitonin reference ranges across studies

</details>

## Limitations

This study has several limitations that should be considered:

1. **Small sample size**: 149 patients is still typical for rare genetic conditions but limits statistical power
2. **Retrospective data**: Extracted from published case series, not prospective validation
3. **Study heterogeneity**: Different calcitonin reference ranges and protocols across 10 studies
4. **Limited diversity**: Primarily European descent patients; generalizability to other populations unknown
5. **No external validation**: Performance validated on held-out data from same studies, not independent cohorts

**However**: These limitations are representative of rare disease ML challenges. The results show that augmentation can help some models substantially while leaving the strongest literature-derived sensitivity result in the original-data benchmark, which is exactly why explicit cross-dataset comparison matters.

**Next steps**: Prospective validation in clinical setting with multi-center collaboration.
