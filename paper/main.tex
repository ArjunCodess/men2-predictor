\section*{Abstract}
Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN2) is a rare hereditary endocrine cancer syndrome caused by germline mutations in the proto-oncogene REarranged during Transfection (RET). MEN2 is clinically associated with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and may also involve pheochromocytoma and primary hyperparathyroidism; biochemical evaluation often includes serum calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), which are frequently elevated in MTC \cite{doi_10_1089_thy_2014_0335}.

A key barrier in resource-limited settings is access to confirmatory RET genetic testing, which can be cost-prohibitive for many families. We address this gap by developing a reproducible machine learning workflow for screening-oriented risk stratification using routinely reported clinical features and biomarkers. The prediction task is binary classification of MTC status (MTC vs.\ no MTC) in literature-derived MEN2/RET-carrier cohorts, intended to support prioritization and follow-up rather than replace genetic diagnosis.

Patient-level data were curated from published case reports and cohorts, yielding 152 confirmed RET carriers across 20 peer-reviewed studies spanning 24 RET variants and ATA risk levels 1--3. Key inputs include demographic and presentation variables, RET variant and risk level (when known), and biomarkers including calcitonin and CEA.

We implemented a pipeline that harmonizes heterogeneous sources, imputes missing CEA values using Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations with Predictive Mean Matching (MICE+PMM), engineers variant-aware interactions, benchmarks five model families (logistic regression, random forest, LightGBM, XGBoost, and linear SVM) under stratified validation with Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) applied to training folds, and automatically quantifies uncertainty through bootstrap confidence intervals (1,000 iterations).

On the original paper-only cohort, XGBoost and SVM achieved 100\% recall (zero missed cancers) with 74.19\% and 64.52\% accuracy respectively. In the case-control setting (n = 1{,}069 total records), LightGBM achieved the highest accuracy (97.20\%) with 96.08\% recall. These results support MEN2 Predictor as a screening and risk-stratification aid to complement genetic testing and clinical guidelines, with prospective validation required prior to clinical deployment.

\section{Introduction}
Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) syndromes are hereditary endocrine disorders classically categorized as MEN1, MEN2, and MEN4. MEN2 is caused by germline mutations in the proto-oncogene RET and is clinically subdivided into MEN2A, MEN2B, and Familial Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma (FMTC). The central clinical threat across MEN2 subtypes is medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), a potentially fatal malignancy arising from parafollicular C-cells. MEN2A commonly involves MTC and may also present with pheochromocytoma and primary hyperparathyroidism; MEN2B is associated with aggressive MTC and pheochromocytoma and may include non-endocrine manifestations; and FMTC is typically characterized by MTC with limited extra-thyroid features \cite{doi_10_1089_thy_2014_0335}.

\subsection{Problem and Proposed Solution}
Definitive diagnosis and cascade screening rely on genetic assays (e.g., Next Generation Sequencing or Sanger sequencing of RET exons), which can remain cost-prohibitive in resource-limited settings. In India, testing commonly ranges from approximately INR 19{,}000--20{,}000, limiting access for many families. This creates a practical gap between clinical suspicion and confirmatory genotyping, especially when biomarker monitoring (e.g., calcitonin and CEA) or imaging suggests elevated risk.

Our goal is to translate published clinical observations into an accessible, reproducible machine learning workflow that supports screening-oriented risk stratification. Rather than replacing genetic diagnosis, the intended use is to aid prioritization and follow-up by estimating the likelihood of MTC given available clinical presentation features and biomarkers, and to benchmark how augmentation strategies affect sensitivity in a safety-critical setting.

\subsection{Related Work}
Clinical decision-making for MEN2 is guided by genotype--phenotype correlations and evidence-based management recommendations, including biomarker-informed surveillance and intervention thresholds \cite{doi_10_1089_thy_2014_0335}. In contrast, machine learning for MEN2 is limited by the rarity of the condition and the lack of large, standardized datasets. Most published evidence consists of heterogeneous case reports and small cohorts, which are valuable for mechanistic insight but challenging for reproducible model training and evaluation.

\subsection{Challenges}
Rare-disease modeling introduces several challenges: small sample size, heterogeneous reporting across sources, incomplete biomarker measurements, and class imbalance between MTC and non-MTC cases. These issues can inflate apparent accuracy, destabilize sensitivity, and complicate fair model comparison. Additionally, synthetic augmentation can improve accuracy yet introduce clinically unacceptable recall volatility. MEN2 Predictor is designed to surface these trade-offs through a transparent pipeline with explicit evaluation on both the original paper-only cohort and an expanded case-control setting.

\section{Materials and Methods}

\subsection{Data Sources}
This study is a retrospective secondary analysis of published, de-identified, patient-level data extracted from twenty peer-reviewed studies \cite{doi_10_1210_jcemcr_luaf002,doi_10_3390_genes13050864,doi_10_1186_s12887_020_02224_4,doi_10_1016_j_ando_2015_10_007,doi_10_1007_s00595_013_0826_8,doi_10_1097_MS9_0000000000002923,doi_10_1155_2012_491054,doi_10_1155_2020_4147097,doi_10_3390_clinpract14060179,doi_10_1530_EDM_24_0009,doi_10_4103_ijc_IJC_639_19,doi_10_1210_jc_2015_2948,doi_10_12998_wjcc_v12_i15_2627,doi_10_1089_thy_2016_0374,doi_10_1530_eje_1_02216,doi_10_1210_jc_2017_02402,doi_10_18632_oncotarget_4992,doi_10_12659_AJCR_935207,doi_10_1210_clinem_dgac222}. The paper-only dataset contains 152 confirmed RET carriers across 24 variants with the binary target label MTC vs. no MTC.

\subsection{Policy and Ethics}
No new human participants were recruited and no animal experiments were conducted. The analysis uses only secondary data derived from published studies without additional identifiable patient information. Institutional review board approval was not required for analysis of published, de-identified secondary data.

\subsection{Statement of Informed Consent}
Informed consent was not obtained for this analysis because it did not involve direct interaction with participants; consent and ethics approvals (where applicable) were handled by the original studies.

\subsection{Feature Construction}
The pipeline constructs demographic, genetic, biomarker, and clinical features including age, sex, RET variant (one-hot encoded), ATA-aligned variant risk level, calcitonin and CEA measurements (with missingness indicators), thyroid ultrasound nodule features, family history of MTC, pheochromocytoma, and hyperparathyroidism.

\subsection{Biomarker Integration and Imputation}
CEA missingness is handled using multivariate imputation by chained equations with predictive mean matching \cite{doi_10_18637_jss_v045_i03}. The imputation model is informed by 34 observed paired calcitonin--CEA measurements across twelve cohorts (including a ctDNA cohort contributing 16 pairs). The observed calcitonin--CEA Pearson correlation is 0.2425 (n = 34), and the imputation strategy is applied after cohort assembly to preserve reproducibility.

\subsection{Datasets: Paper-Only and Expanded Case-Control}
Two datasets are evaluated:
(i) \textbf{Original (paper-only)}: the 152-carrier cohort.
(ii) \textbf{Case-control}: the original cohort augmented with variant-matched synthetic controls and trained with SMOTE class balancing applied only to the training split \cite{doi_10_1613_jair_953}. The case-control dataset comprises 1{,}069 total records.

\subsection{Models}
Five models are benchmarked: logistic regression, random forest, linear support vector machine (SVM), XGBoost \cite{doi_10_1145_2939672_2939785}, and LightGBM \cite{ke2017lightgbm}. Model training and evaluation follow a standardized pipeline implemented with scikit-learn \cite{pedregosa2011scikit}.
Logistic regression is used as the linear baseline model to estimate the probability of MTC from the engineered feature vector.

\subsection{Code Availability}
The pipeline, data artifacts, and figure-generation scripts are available in the GitHub repository: \url{https://github.com/arjuncodess/men2-predictor}.

\subsection{Training and Statistical Approach}
Each dataset is split using an 80/20 stratified train/test partition with fixed random seed (random\_state = 42). Hyperparameter tuning is performed via cross-validation on the training split, and SMOTE is applied only to the training data to mitigate leakage. Performance metrics include accuracy, precision, recall (sensitivity), F1-score, ROC-AUC, and average precision. Uncertainty quantification through 95\% bootstrap confidence intervals (1{,}000 iterations) is automatically performed for all models. Recall stability between original and expanded workflows is evaluated using permutation testing (10{,}000 shuffles); McNemar's test is not applicable because positive cases differ between the original and expanded test sets.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Cohort Summary}
The paper-only cohort includes 152 RET carriers across 20 studies, with 72 MTC cases and 107 females / 45 males. Mean age is 35.44 years (median 34.0; range 1--90).

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\caption{Summary of the paper-only cohort (n = 152 RET carriers).}
\begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}}
\toprule

Observed calcitonin--CEA pairs & 34 (12 cohorts) \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Screening-Safe Baseline on Paper-Only Data}
On the paper-only test split (31 patients), XGBoost and SVM achieve 100\% recall (sensitivity) with 74.19\% and 64.52\% accuracy respectively. In safety-critical screening, sensitivity is prioritized because each missed case corresponds to a potentially undetected cancer.

\subsection{Effect of Synthetic Augmentation}
Synthetic expansion increases accuracy substantially for ensemble models, with LightGBM achieving 97.20\% accuracy and 96.08\% recall on the expanded test split (44 patients). Relative to the paper-only baseline, augmentation can reduce recall for some models; permutation testing did not detect statistically significant recall drops under the study's test-set structure.

Logistic Regression & 0.7097 & 0.8667 & 0.7944 & 0.9804 \\
Random Forest & 0.8065 & 0.9333 & 0.9346 & 0.9608 \\
LightGBM & 0.8065 & 0.8667 & 0.9720 & 0.9608 \\
XGBoost & 0.7419 & 1.0000 & 0.8738 & 0.9804 \\
SVM (Linear) & 0.6452 & 1.0000 & 0.4626 & 0.9804 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Interpretability}
The pipeline computes SHAP attributions \cite{lundberg2017shap} for supported models and provides per-model feature-importance summaries. In the expanded LightGBM model, genotype and biomarker features jointly contribute to risk stratification, consistent with clinical expectations that risk depends on both variant class and biochemical phenotype.

\section{Discussion}
The results demonstrate that the MEN2 Predictor pipeline achieves clinically acceptable sensitivity while maintaining reasonable specificity across multiple model architectures. However, methodological concerns have been raised regarding the use of genetic features and biomarker imputation strategies, which warrant detailed examination.

\subsection{Ablation Study: Feature Contribution Analysis}

A systematic ablation study was conducted to address the concern that ATA risk level and RET variant features may ``encode cancer a priori,'' thereby inflating apparent model performance through circular reasoning rather than genuine predictive learning.

\textbf{Methodology:} We systematically removed feature groups across all five model architectures on both datasets, testing eight configurations including: removal of ATA risk level, removal of variant one-hot encodings, removal of all genetic features, and removal of biomarker features.

\textbf{Key Findings:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Biomarkers-only achieves strong performance:} When all genetic features (ATA risk level + variant encodings) are removed, the model still achieves 90.2--94.9\% accuracy on the expanded dataset. LightGBM achieves 94.86\% accuracy with 96.08\% recall using only biomarker and demographic features.

\item \textbf{Genetics-only underperforms biomarkers-only:} Models using only genetic features (with all biomarkers removed) achieve 81.8--92.1\% accuracy, which is 5--10 percentage points lower than biomarkers-only configurations. This demonstrates that the model learns primarily from clinical biomarker patterns rather than ``restating consensus knowledge.''

\item \textbf{ATA risk level has minimal impact:} Removing ATA risk level causes only 0--2.8\% accuracy change across models. If the model were merely encoding genetic risk stratification, removing this feature should cause substantial performance degradation.

\item \textbf{Variant encodings add no predictive value:} Removing variant one-hot features causes zero or positive accuracy changes, indicating these features are redundant given other model inputs.
\end{enumerate}

Complete ablation results are provided in Supplementary Table S2.

\subsection{Calcitonin Feature Behavior: Real vs Synthetic Data}

An important observation emerged from the ablation study: removing calcitonin features has \textbf{different effects} depending on the dataset. On the expanded dataset (86\% synthetic records), removing calcitonin improves LightGBM accuracy from 96.73\% to 98.13\% (+1.40\%), with similar improvements for Random Forest (+1.86\%), SVM (+2.34\%), and Logistic Regression (+2.80\%).

However, on the original paper-only dataset (100\% real patients), removing calcitonin has \textbf{zero effect} on any model's accuracy. This contrast reveals the true nature of the finding: it is a synthetic data quality issue, not a clinical insight about calcitonin.

\textbf{Interpretation:} When synthetic records dominate the dataset, features that are poorly modeled in the generation process can introduce noise rather than signal. The synthetic calcitonin values likely do not accurately capture real-world biomarker distributions. This observation is consistent with known challenges in synthetic data generation, including difficulty capturing complex multi-dimensional correlations and the risk of ``sterile'' synthetic features that lack realistic noise characteristics.

\textbf{Clinical implications:} This finding does not diminish calcitonin's established clinical value for MTC surveillance. Rather, it demonstrates that ablation studies comparing real and synthetic datasets are essential when evaluating synthetic-augmented models. Feature importance rankings derived from synthetic-trained models may not reflect clinical reality.

\subsection{Empirical Validation of CEA Imputation}

The observed calcitonin--CEA correlation (r = 0.24, n = 34) represents a weak association. Concerns about imputation reliability are valid given this modest correlation. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis was conducted comparing model performance with and without CEA features, and across five different imputation methods.

\textbf{CEA Contribution Analysis:} LightGBM achieves 97.20\% accuracy with CEA features and 96.73\% without CEA features on the expanded dataset, a difference of only 0.47 percentage points. This finding demonstrates that CEA provides minimal predictive benefit for initial MTC detection.

\textbf{Imputation Method Robustness:} Testing four imputation strategies (MICE+PMM, mean, median, zero) showed accuracy variation of less than 1 percentage point (96.26\%--97.20\%). The current MICE+PMM approach achieves the highest accuracy (97.20\%), while even naive zero imputation achieved 96.26\% accuracy, only 0.93\% below baseline.

\textbf{Clinical Rationale for CEA Inclusion:} Despite minimal predictive benefit, CEA was included for clinical reasons. Calcitonin alone has specificity limitations---elevated levels can occur in hypergastrinemia, kidney insufficiency, other neuroendocrine tumors, and with certain medications (omeprazole, beta-blockers). Clinical guidelines recommend combined calcitonin-CEA assessment because CEA adds complementary prognostic value: CEA doubling time indicates disease aggressiveness, and rising CEA without calcitonin change may signal poorly differentiated (more aggressive) MTC. Including both markers aligns with standard clinical practice for MEN2 management.

\textbf{Safeguards:} The pipeline includes a binary \texttt{cea\_imputed\_flag} feature that explicitly preserves missingness information. Complete validation results across all five model architectures are available in the project repository under \texttt{results/cea\_validation/}.

\subsection{Biomarker Collection Timing in Source Studies}

Concerns have been raised that calcitonin and CEA measurements may be ``post-diagnostic markers'' collected after MTC was already clinically confirmed, which would introduce information leakage if the model is intended for screening.

\textbf{Classification of Source Studies:} We reviewed the timing of biomarker collection across all 20 source studies:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Pre-diagnostic (screening):} 7 studies (35\%) collected biomarkers as part of surveillance protocols for asymptomatic RET mutation carriers, before MTC was histologically confirmed.
\item \textbf{Post-diagnostic (clinical):} 5 studies (25\%) collected biomarkers after symptomatic presentation and diagnosis.
\item \textbf{Mixed:} 8 studies (40\%) included both index patients with clinical presentations and family members identified through subsequent screening.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Interpretation:} The majority of source data (75\%) includes biomarker measurements from pre-diagnostic or mixed contexts, consistent with the clinical role of calcitonin as a screening biomarker in MEN2 surveillance protocols.

\subsection{Limitations}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Sample size:} The paper-only cohort of 152 RET carriers is small by machine learning standards, limiting generalizability and increasing variance in performance estimates.

\item \textbf{Heterogeneous data sources:} Biomarker collection protocols varied across studies, and the mixture of screening and clinical contexts introduces heterogeneity that should be addressed in prospective validation.

\item \textbf{Imputation uncertainty:} Although CEA imputation demonstrated empirical utility, the weak underlying correlation means imputed values carry substantial uncertainty that is not fully captured by confidence intervals.

\item \textbf{Synthetic augmentation:} The expanded dataset relies on variant-matched synthetic controls, which may not fully represent the clinical heterogeneity of real patient populations.

\item \textbf{Prospective validation required:} External validation on independent cohorts is essential before any clinical deployment.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}
MEN2 Predictor presents a reproducible machine learning workflow for rare-disease risk stratification by aggregating published MEN2/RET-carrier evidence into a structured dataset and standardized evaluation pipeline. On the literature-derived cohort of 152 confirmed RET carriers spanning 24 variants (ATA risk levels 1--3), XGBoost and SVM achieved 100\% recall with 74.19\% and 64.52\% accuracy respectively, serving as conservative ``zero-miss'' screening-oriented models where sensitivity is prioritized over overall accuracy.

In a case-control setting (n = 1{,}069 total records) using variant-matched synthetic controls and SMOTE applied to training folds, LightGBM achieved the highest accuracy (97.20\%) with 96.08\% recall. These results suggest that augmentation can improve discrimination for triage-style use, but recall volatility remains a critical risk in safety-sensitive workflows where missed cancers are unacceptable.

Key limitations include the cohort size, heterogeneity across published sources, and biomarker missingness requiring imputation. Prospective external validation is required before clinical deployment. Overall, MEN2 Predictor is best positioned as a screening and prioritization aid that complements, rather than replaces, genetic testing and guideline-based care.
