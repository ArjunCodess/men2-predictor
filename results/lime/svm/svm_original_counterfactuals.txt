COUNTERFACTUAL ANALYSIS (HIGH-RISK CASES)
============================================================
High-risk definition: predicted probability >= 0.20

Patient study_9 (sample 6) - predicted risk 0.689
  1. To reduce risk, patient would need to bring calcitonin into normal range (calcitonin_elevated: 1 -> 0)

Patient study_6 (sample 7) - predicted risk 0.460
  1. To reduce risk, patient would need to bring calcitonin into normal range (calcitonin_elevated: 1 -> 0)
