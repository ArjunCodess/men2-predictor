COUNTERFACTUAL ANALYSIS (HIGH-RISK CASES)
============================================================
High-risk definition: predicted probability >= 0.20

Patient study_5 (sample 84) - predicted risk 0.559
  1. To reduce risk, patient would need to bring calcitonin into normal range (calcitonin_elevated: 1 -> 0)

Patient study_4 (sample 115) - predicted risk 0.508
  1. To reduce risk, patient would need to bring calcitonin into normal range (calcitonin_elevated: 1 -> 0)
