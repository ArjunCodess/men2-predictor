COUNTERFACTUAL ANALYSIS (HIGH-RISK CASES)
============================================================
High-risk definition: predicted probability >= 0.20

Patient study_1 (sample 4) - predicted risk 0.642
  1. To reduce risk, patient would need to bring calcitonin into normal range (calcitonin_elevated: 1 -> 0)

Patient study_6 (sample 12) - predicted risk 0.614
  1. To reduce risk, patient would need to bring calcitonin into normal range (calcitonin_elevated: 1 -> 0)
