Model: logistic
Dataset: expanded
LIME explained: 10 samples
Correct: 5, Misclassified: 5
LIME vs SHAP agreements: 0, partial: 6, disagree: 4

Counterfactual highlights:
Patient study_7 (sample 5) - predicted risk 0.661
  1. To reduce risk, patient would need to bring calcitonin into normal range (calcitonin_elevated: 1 -> 0)

Patient study_6 (sample 12) - predicted risk 0.593
  1. To reduce risk, patient would need to bring calcitonin into normal range (calcitonin_elevated: 1 -> 0)

Patient study_5 (sample 15) - predicted risk 0.683
  1. To reduce risk, patient would need to bring calcitonin into normal range (calcitonin_elevated: 1 -> 0)
