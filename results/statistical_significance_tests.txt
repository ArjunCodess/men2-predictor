- Recall Drop (original - expanded): 17.9%
- Bootstrap Mean Drop: 18.0% (Std: 0.061, 95% CI: [7.7%, 30.8%])
- McNemar's Test: No overlapping positive patients; McNemar's test not applicable.
- Permutation Test p-value: 0.1829
- Significance (alpha=0.05/0.01/0.001): 0.050:No/0.010:No/0.001:No

Overall Conclusion:
Permutation testing did not flag any recall drops as statistically significant.

McNemar's test could not be applied because the original and expanded test sets share no overlapping positive patients; therefore, we rely on permutation and bootstrap analyses to quantify uncertainty.
